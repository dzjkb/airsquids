#Flying squids!
## (and other water mobs)

Allows squids, dolphins and other water mobs to swim through air using the new "waterlogged" block attribute,
by dynamically making air blocks around them waterlogged, i.e. behave like water.

## Pros:

* Flying dolphins wot!
* Flying guardians shooting lazers through the sky holy shit!

## Cons:

* Flying mobs make surrounding air waterlogged, which means it will behave like water for all entities
  (items, players can suffocate, etc.)
